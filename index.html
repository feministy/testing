title: Intro to Testing for Ruby and JavaScript
---

<p>
  When I first started programming, I didn't really have a strong understanding of how to test or what my options were. I learned someone else's favorites ways of testing and didn't really pursue other options. Which, if I'm honest, is because I didn't fully understand how important testing was.
</p>

<p>
  Now that I've been doing this for a little while, I understand how important testing is. I love writing tests. I love seeing the shiny green success messages fly across my screen. But when I first started to really get into testing, I didn't know where to turn or what to do. There's lots of stuff on the internet folks, and some of it if super crazy. So I created this project!

<p>
  Unit testing tutortials all use a calculator object that shares the same basic functionality, advancing in complexity as you step through the tutorials. I often find that the best way to learn a new way of testing things is to use something simple that mimics a real-world object. I really like using a calculator as an example because it can be as complex or as simple as you want it to be.
